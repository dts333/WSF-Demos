|1.3
|*1.1* For the distribution of ages in the example in Section 1.3.1:

. Compute stem:[\langle j^2 \rangle] and stem:[\langle j \rangle ^2]
. Determine stem:[\Delta j] for each stem:[j], and use Equation 1.11 to compute the standard deviation.
. Use your results in (a) and (b) to check Equation 1.12.

| You survey you neighbors to determine the number of pets they have in their households and collect the following data:

0 xxx +
1 xxxxxx +
2 xxxxx +
3 xx +
4 xx +
5 +
6 x +
7  +
8 +
9 +
10 x +

Verify that both ways of computing standard deviation give the same answer (i.e. show that stem:[\sqrt{\langle (\Delta j)^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\langle j^2 \rangle - \langle j \rangle ^2}]  )

function

[stem]
++++
\[\Psi(x,0)=
    \begin{cases}
        A(x/a), & 0\le x \le a,\\
        A(b-x)/A(b-a), & a \le x \le b,\\
        0, & \textrm{otherwise},
    \end{cases}\]
++++
where stem:[A], stem:[a], and stem:[b] are
(positive) constants.

. Normalize stem:[\Psi] (that is, find stem:[A] in terms
of stem:[a] and stem:[b]).
. Sketch stem:[\Psi(x,0)] as a function of stem:[x].
. Where is the particle most likely to be found at stem:[t=0]?
. What is the probability of finding the particle to the left of
stem:[a]? Check your result in the limiting cases
stem:[b=a] and stem:[b=2a].
. What is the expectation value of stem:[x]?

|At time stem:[t=0] a particle is represented by the wave
function

[stem]
++++
\[\Psi(x,0)=
    \begin{cases}
        A\sin{\frac{2 \pi x}{L}}, & 0\le x \le L\\
        0, & \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]
++++
where stem:[A] and stem:[L] are
(positive) constants.

|1.5
|*1.8* Suppose you add a constant stem:[V_0] to the
potential energy (by "`constant`" I mean independent of stem:[x]
as well as stem:[t]). In _classical_ mechanics this doesn't
change anything, but what about _quantum_ mechanics? Show that the wave
function picks up a time-dependent phase factor:
stem:[\exp(-iV_0t/\hbar)]. What effect does this have on the
expectation value of a dynamical variable?
|*Note*: I like this problem, but I am not sure how to alter it...

|1.P
|*1.10* Consider the first 25 digits in the decimal expansion of
stem:[\pi] (stem:[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, \ldots]).

. If you selected one number at random, from this set, what are the
probabilities of getting each of the 10 digits?
. What is the most probable digit? What is the median digit? What is the
average value?
. Find the standard deviation for this distribution.

|Here are the first 20 digits of stem:[\sqrt{2}]: 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, 9, 5, 0, 4, 8, 8.

. If you selected one number at random, from this set, what are the
probabilities of getting each of the 10 digits?
. What is the most probable digit? What is the median digit? What is the
average value?
. Find the standard deviation for this distribution.


|1.P
|*1.11* [This problem generalizes Example 1.2.] Imagine a particle of mass stem:[m] and energy stem:[E] in a potential well stem:[V(x)], sliding frictionlessly back and forth between the classical turning points (stem:[a] and stem:[b] in Figure 1.10).
Classically, the probability of finding the particle in the range stem:[dx] (if, for example, you took a snapshot at a random time stem:[t]) is equal to the fraction of the time stem:[T] it takes to get from stem:[a] to stem:[b] that it spends in the interval stem:[dx]:

[stem]
++++
\rho(x)\,dx=\frac{dt}{T}=\frac{(dt/dx)\,dx}{T}=\frac{1}{v(x)T}\,dx,
++++

where stem:[v(x)] is the speed, and

[stem]
++++
T=\int_0^T dt = \int_a^b \frac{1}{v(x)}\,dx.
++++

Thus
[stem]
++++
\rho(x)=\frac{1}{v(x)T}
++++

This is perhaps the closest classical analog to stem:[\|\Psi\|^2].

. Use conservation of energy to express stem:[v(x)] in terms of stem:[E] and stem:[V(x)].
. As an example, find stem:[\rho(x)] for the simple harmonic oscillator, stem:[V(x)=k x^2/2]. Plot stem:[\rho(x)], and check that it is correctly normalized.
. For the classical harmonic oscillator in part (b), find stem:[\langle x\rangle], stem:[\langle x^2\rangle], and stem:[\sigma_x].

| *Note*: This problem and problem 1.2
 are both based on Griffiths's example 1.2 (which is a cool example!). I'm not sure whether it makes the sense to keep these as is, or entirely change the problems/find new ones.

|1.P
|**{blank}*{blank}* 1.12** What if we were interested in the distribution of _momenta_
(stem:[p=mv]) for the classical harmonic oscillator (Problem
1.11(b)).

. Find the classical probability distribution stem:[\rho(p)]
(note that stem:[p] ranges from stem:[-\sqrt{2mE}] to
stem:[+\sqrt{2mE}]).
. Calculate stem:[\langle p \rangle],
stem:[\langle p^2 \rangle], and stem:[\sigma_{p}].
. What’s the _classical_ uncertainty product,
stem:[\sigma_{x}\sigma_{p}], for this system? Notice that this
product can be as small as you like, classically, simply by sending
stem:[E \rightarrow 0]. But in quantum mechanics, as we shall see
in Chapter 2, the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator cannot be less
than stem:[\hbar \omega /2], where
stem:[\omega = \sqrt{k/m}] is the classical frequency. In that
case what can you say abut the product
stem:[\sigma_{x}\sigma_{p}]?

|PROBLEM

|1.P
|*1.13* Check your results in Problem 1.11(b) with the following “numerical experiment.” The position of the oscillator at time stem:[t] is

[stem]
++++
x(t) = A\cos(\omega t)
++++


You might as well take stem:[\omega=1] (that sets the scale for time) and stem:[A=1] (that sets the scale for length). Make a plot of stem:[x] at 10,000 random times, and compare it with stem:[\rho[x]].
_Hint_: In Mathematica, first define

[source,mathematica]
----
x[t_] := Cos[t]
----

then construct a table of positions:

[source,mathematica]
----
snapshots = Table[x[𝜋 RandomReal[j]], {j, 10000}]
----

and finally, make a histogram of the data:

[source,mathematica]
----
Histogram[snapshots, 100, "PDF", PlotRange -> {0,2}]
----

Meanwhile, make a plot of the density function, stem:[\rho(x)], and, using `Show`, superimpose the two.
| PROBLEM

|1.P
|*1.14* Let stem:[P_{ab}(t)] be the probability of finding the
particle in the range stem:[(a<x<b)], at time stem:[t].

. Show that
+
[stem]
++++
\[\frac{dP_{ab}}{dt} = J(a,t) - J(b,t)\]
++++
where
+
[stem]
++++
\[J(x,t) \equiv \frac{i
    \hbar}{2m}\left(\Psi\frac{\partial\Psi^{*}}{\partial x}-\Psi^{*}\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial x}\right)\]
++++
What are the units of stem:[J(x,t)]? _Comment:_ stem:[J]
is called the *probability current* because it tells you the rate at
which probability is "`flowing`" past the point stem:[x]. If
stem:[P_{ab}(t)] is increasing, then more probability is flowing
into the region at one end than flows out the other.
. Find the probability current for the wave function in Problem 1.9.
(This is not a very pithy example, I’m afraid; we’ll encounter more
substantial ones in due course.)

|
. Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem[Gauss's Theorem] to extend this result to an arbitrary region stem:[S] in stem:[\mathbb R^n].
. [From the Bernd Thaller book] Write stem:[\psi(x,t)=\|\psi(x,t)\|e^{i\varphi(x,t)}].
Show that stem:[J] as defined above points in the direction of stem:[\nabla \varphi], i.e., in the direction of increasing phase.

| 1.P
|*1.15* Show that

[latexmath]
++++
\[\frac{d}{dt}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Psi_{1}^{*}\Psi_{2}\,dx = 0\]
++++
for any two (normalizable) solutions to the Schrödinger equation (with
the same stem:[V(x)]), stem:[\Psi_{1}] and
stem:[\Psi_{2}].
| PROBLEM

|1.P
|*1.16* A particle is represented (at time stem:[t=0]) by the wave function

[latexmath]
++++
\Psi(x,0)=\begin{cases}
A(a^2-x^2)&-a\le x\le +a\\
0 &\textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
++++

. Determine the normalization constant stem:[A].
. What is the expectation value of stem:[x]?
. What is the expectation value of stem:[p]? (Note that you
_cannot_ get it from
stem:[\langle p \rangle = m\,d\langle x \rangle/dt]. Why not?)
. Find the expectation value of stem:[x^2].
. Find the expectation value of stem:[p^2].
. Find the uncertainty in stem:[x] (stem:[\sigma_{x}]).
. Find the uncertainty in stem:[p] (stem:[\sigma_{p}]).
. Check that your results are consistent with the uncertainty principle.

|PROBLEM

|1.P
|*1.17* Suppose you wanted to describe an *unstable particle* that spontaneously
disintegrates with a ``lifetime'' stem:[\tau]. In that case the
total probability of finding the particle somewhere should _not_ be
constant, but should decrease at (say) an exponential rate:

[latexmath]
++++
\[P(t) \equiv \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\|\Psi(x,t)\|^2dx=e^{-t/\tau}\]
++++
A crude way of achieving this result is as follows. In Equation 1.24 we
tacitly assumed that V (the potential energy) is _real_. That is
certainly reasonable, but it leads to the "`conservation of
probability`" enshrined in Equation 1.27. What if we assign to
stem:[V] an imaginary part:

[latexmath]
++++
\[V=V_{0}-i\Gamma\]
++++
where stem:[V_{0}] is the true potential energy and
stem:[\Gamma] is a positive real constant?

. Show that (in place of Equation 1.27) we now get
+
[latexmath]
++++
\frac{dP}{dt} = -\frac{2\Gamma}{\hbar}P.
++++
. Solve for stem:[P(t)], and find the lifetime of the particle in
terms of stem:[\Gamma].
|PROBLEM

|1.P
|*1.18* Very roughly speaking, quantum mechanics is relevant when the de Broglie
wavelength of the particle in question (stem:[h/p]) is greater
than the characteristic size of the system (stem:[d]). In thermal
equilibrium at (Kelvin) temperature stem:[T], the average kinetic
energy of a particle is

[latexmath]
++++
\[\frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{3}{2}k_BT\]
++++
(where stem:[k_B] is Boltzmann’s constant), so the typical de
Broglie wavelength is

[latexmath]
++++
\[\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3mk_BT}}\]
++++
The purpose of this problem is to determine which systems will have to
be treated quantum mechanically and which can safely be described
classically.

. *Solids.* The lattice spacing in a typical solid is around
stem:[d=0.3\,\textrm{mm}]. Find the temperature below which the unbound _electrons_ in a solid are quantum mechanical. Below what temperature are the _nuclei_ in a solid quantum mechanical? (Use silicon as an example.)
+
_Moral_: The free electrons in a solid are _always_ quantum mechanical; the nuclei are generally _not_ quantum mechanical. The same goes for liquids (in which the interatomic spacing is roughly the same), with the exception of helium below stem:[4\,\textrm{K}].

. *Gases.* For what temperatures are the atoms in an ideal gas at pressure stem:[P] quantum mechanical? Hint: Use the ideal gas law (stem:[PV=Nk_BT]) to deduce the interatomic spacing.
_Answer_: stem:[T<(1/k_B)(h^2/3m)^{3/5}P^{2/5}]. Obviously (for the gas to show quantum behavior) we want stem:[m] to be as small as possible, and stem:[P] as large as possible. Put in the numbers for helium at atmospheric pressure. Is hydrogen in outer space (where the interatomic spacing is about stem:[1\,\textrm{cm}] and the temperature is stem:[3\,\textrm{K}]) quantum mechanical? (Assume it's monatomic hydrogen, not stem:[\require{mhchem}\ce{H2}].)
