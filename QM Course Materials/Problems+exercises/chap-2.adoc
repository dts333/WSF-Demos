== Stationary States

* {q-num} Which of the following are always true when we use separation of variables to solve the Schrodinger equation?
** ++\(\Psi(x,t)=\psi(x)\phi(t)\)++
** Both sides of the Schrodinger equation are constant
** ++\(\Psi(x,t)\)++ is a stationary state
** ++\(V(x,t) = V(x)\)++
** ++\(i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = 0\)++

* {q-num} Why is ++\(\Psi(x,t)\)++ called a stationary state if it is time-dependent?
+
[{sublist-style}]
. Show that ++\(|\Psi(x,t)|^2 = |\psi(x)|^2\)++
. Show that ++\( \langle p \rangle = 0\)++ for ++\(\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x)e^{-iEt/\hbar}\)++


* {q-num} [Similar to Griffiths text (not a problem). Need to modify more]
The classical Hamiltonian, the total energy in a system, is given by ++\(H(x,p)=\frac{p^2}{2m}+V(x)\)++, where ++\(\frac{p^2}{2m}\)++ is the kinetic energy and ++\(V(x)\)++ is the potential energy.
+
[{sublist-style}]
** Using the quantum mechanical substitution rule ++\(p \rightarrow -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\)++, find the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian ++\(\hat H\)++.
Substituting this Hamiltonian into the time-independent {sch} equation
++\[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V\psi = E\psi\]++
yields ++\(\hat H\psi=E\psi\)++.
** Show that ++\(\langle \hat H \rangle = E\)++.
** Show that ++\(\langle \hat H^2 \rangle = E^2\)++. (Hint: first show that ++\(\hat H^2\psi=E^2\psi\)++)
** Conclude that the variance of ++\(\hat H\)++ is 0.

+
In other words, every measurement of the total energy of a solution to the time-dependent {sch} equation will yield ++\(E\)++.



* {q-num} If you were to measure the energy of a particle with the wavefunction ++\(\Psi(x,t) = \frac{4}{5}\Psi_1(x,t) - \frac{3i}{5} \Psi_2(x,t)\)++, what is the probability that youâ€™d measure the energy to be ++\(E_2\)++?

* {q-num} Griffiths's questions 2.1 and 2.2 are very good. Check to see how those can be modified.

== The Infinite Square Well

* {q-num} The solutions to the time-independent {sch} equation in the infinite square well of width \(a\) are ++\(\psi_n(x)=\sqrt{2/a}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{a}x\right)\)++.
Show that these functions are _orthonormal_, i.e., that ++\(\langle \psi_m,\psi_n\rangle\)++ is 1 when ++\(m=n\)++ and 0 otherwise.
(Hint: ++\(\cos\)++ is an even function, ++\(\sin\)++ is an odd function, and ++\(\cos(a+b)=\cos a\cos b-\sin a\sin b\)++.)

== The Harmonic Oscillator

=== Questions

* {q-num} Show that every solution of the time-independent harmonic oscillator {sch} equation ++\(\hat H\psi = E\psi\)++ lies on the same "`ladder`": for every pair of solutions ++\(\psi_a,\psi_b\)++, there is some \(n\) for which ++\(\psi_a=\hat a_{\pm}^n\psi_b\)++.
+
NOTE: I actually don't know if this is possible with the ladder operators alone, or if you have to actually solve the {sch} equation in its entirety to deduce that the ladder operators give _all_ the solutions.

* {q-num} For small displacements, the harmonic oscillator is a good second-order approximation of many potential fields.
What is an example of a potential field ++\(V(x)\)++ for which the harmonic oscillator is _not_ a good approximation?

++\(V(x)=x^4\)++ is one such potential, as it has no quadratic terms.

* {q-num} [Thaller] Show that any solution ++\(\Psi\)++ of the harmonic oscillator satisfies ++\(\Psi(x,t+\pi)=e^{-i\pi/2}\Psi(-x,t)\)++. (Corollary: ++\(\Psi(x,t+2\pi)=-\Psi(-x,t)\)++.)

* {q-num} Show that in the harmonic oscillator, ++\(\dot p=-kx\)++.

* {q-num} [Adapted from Griffiths 2.16]
The *Rodrigues formula* says that ++\(H_n(x)=(-1)^n e^{x^2}\frac{d^n}{dx^n}(e^{-x^2})\)++.

NOTE: The stationary states are solved numerically in the browser (requires solving something like ++\(\tan z=\sqrt{(z_0/z)^2-1}\)++, which cannot be solved exactly), so at a handful of slider values a stationary state will be lost.
This is just a bug due to limited precision/compute time.
(Again, the universe is lucky, it gets to run its calculations to arbitrary precision in no time at all.)
