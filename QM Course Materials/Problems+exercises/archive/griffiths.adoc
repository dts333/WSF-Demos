== Chapter 1: The Wave Function

* *G.1.1* For the distribution of ages in the example in Section 1.3.1:
+
[{sublist-style}]
. Compute ++\(\langle j^2 \rangle_\psi\)++ and ++\(\langle j \rangle ^2\)++
. Determine ++\(\Delta j\)++ for each ++\(j\)++, and use Equation 1.11 to compute the standard deviation.
. Use your results in (a) and (b) to check Equation 1.12.

* *G.1.2*
+
[{sublist-style}]
. Find the standard deviation of the distribution in Example 1.2.
. What is the probability that a photograph, selected at random, would
show a distance ++\(x\)++ more than one standard deviation away
from the average?

* *G.1.3* Consider the *gaussian* distribution
++\[\rho(x)= Ae^{-\lambda(x-a)^2}\]++
where ++\(A\)++, ++\(a\)++, and ++\(\lambda\)++ are positive real constants. (The necessary integrals are inside the back cover.)
+
[{sublist-style}]
. Use Equation 1.16 to determine ++\(A\)++.
. Find ++\(\langle x \rangle\)++, ++\(\langle x^2 \rangle\)++, and ++\(\sigma\)++.
. Sketch the graph of ++\(\rho(x)\)++.

* *G.1.4* At time ++\(t=0\)++ a particle is represented by the wave
function
+
\[\Psi(x,0)=
    \begin{cases}
        A(x/a), & 0\le x \le a,\\
        A(b-x)/A(b-a), & a \le x \le b,\\
        0, & \textrm{otherwise},
    \end{cases}\]
where ++\(A\)++, ++\(a\)++, and ++\(b\)++ are
(positive) constants.
+
[{sublist-style}]
. Normalize ++\(\Psi\)++ (that is, find ++\(A\)++ in terms
of ++\(a\)++ and ++\(b\)++).
. Sketch ++\(\Psi(x,0)\)++ as a function of ++\(x\)++.
. Where is the particle most likely to be found at ++\(t=0\)++?
. What is the probability of finding the particle to the left of
++\(a\)++? Check your result in the limiting cases
++\(b=a\)++ and ++\(b=2a\)++.
. What is the expectation value of ++\(x\)++?


* *G.1.5* Consider the wave function
++\[\Psi(x,t)=Ae^{-\lambda|x|}e^{-i \omega t}\]++
where ++\(A\)++, ++\(\lambda\)++, and ++\(\omega\)++ are positive real constants.
(We'll see in Chapter 2 for what potential (++\(V\)++) this wave function satisfies the {sch} equation.)
+
[{sublist-style}]
. Normalize ++\(\Psi\)++.
. Determine the expectation values of ++\(x\)++ and ++\(x^2\)++.
. Find the standard deviation of ++\(x\)++.
+
Sketch the graph of ++\(|\Psi|^2\)++, as a function of ++\(x\)++, and mark the points ++\((\langle x \rangle + \sigma)\)++ and ++\((\langle x \rangle - \sigma)\)++, to illustrate the sense in which ++\(\sigma\)++ represents the "`spread`" in ++\(x\)++. What is the probability that the particle would be found outside this range?

* *G.1.6*
Why can't you do integration-by-parts directly on the middle expression in Equation 1.29 -- pull the time derivative over onto \(x\), note that ++\(\partial x / \partial t = 0\)++, and conclude that ++\(d\langle x \rangle / dt = 0\)++?

* *G.1.7* Calculate ++\(\frac{d\langle p \rangle}{dt}\)++. Answer:
+
++\[\frac{d\langle p \rangle}{dt} = \left\langle- \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} \right\rangle.\]++
This is an instance of *Ehrenfest's theorem*, which asserts that
_expectation values obey the classical laws_.


* *G.1.8* Suppose you add a constant ++\(V_0\)++ to the
potential energy (by "`constant`" I mean independent of ++\(x\)++
as well as ++\(t\)++). In _classical_ mechanics this doesn't
change anything, but what about _quantum_ mechanics? Show that the wave
function picks up a time-dependent phase factor:
++\(\exp(-iV_0t/\hbar)\)++. What effect does this have on the
expectation value of a dynamical variable?

* *G.1.9* A particle of mass ++\(m\)++ has the wave function
++\[\Psi(x,t) = Ae^{-a[(mx^2/\hbar)+it]},\]++

. For what potential energy function, ++\(V(x)\)++, is this a
solution to the {sch} equation?
. Calculate the expectation values of ++\(x\)++,
++\(x^2\)++, ++\(p\)++, and ++\(p^2\)++.
. Find ++\(\sigma_{x}\)++ and ++\(\sigma_{p}\)++. Is their
product consistent with the uncertainty principle?

* *G.1.10*
+
Consider the first 25 digits in the decimal expansion of ++\(\pi\)++: ++\(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, \ldots\)++.
+
[{sublist-style}]
. If you selected one number at random, from this set, what are the
probabilities of getting each of the 10 digits?
. What is the most probable digit? What is the median digit? What is the
average value?

[This problem generalizes Example 1.2.] Imagine a particle of mass ++\(m\)++ and energy ++\(E\)++ in a potential well ++\(V(x)\)++, sliding frictionlessly back and forth between the classical turning points (++\(a\)++ and ++\(b\)++ in Figure 1.10).

Classically, the probability of finding the particle in the range ++\(dx\)++ (if, for example, you took a snapshot at a random time ++\(t\)++) is equal to the fraction of the time ++\(T\)++ it takes to get from ++\(a\)++ to ++\(b\)++ that it spends in the interval ++\(dx\)++:

++\[\rho(x)\,dx=\frac{dt}{T}=\frac{(dt/dx)\,dx}{T}=\frac{1}{v(x)T}\,dx,\]++

where ++\(v(x)\)++ is the speed, and

++\[T=\int_0^T dt = \int_a^b \frac{1}{v(x)}\,dx.\]++

Thus
++\[\rho(x)=\frac{1}{v(x)T}\]++

This is perhaps the closest classical analog to ++\(|\Psi|^2\)++.
[{sublist-style}]
. Use conservation of energy to express ++\(v(x)\)++ in terms of ++\(E\)++ and ++\(V(x)\)++.
. As an example, find ++\(\rho(x)\)++ for the simple harmonic oscillator, ++\(V(x)=k x^2/2\)++. Plot ++\(\rho(x)\)++, and check that it is correctly normalized.
. For the classical harmonic oscillator in part (b), find ++\(\langle x\rangle\)++, ++\(\langle x^2\rangle\)++, and ++\(\sigma_x\)++.

* *G.1.11*
Griffiths:::
+
**{blank}*{blank}* 1.12** What if we were interested in the distribution of _momenta_
(++\(p=mv\)++) for the classical harmonic oscillator (Problem
1.11(b)).
+
[{sublist-style}]
. Find the classical probability distribution ++\(\rho(p)\)++
(note that ++\(p\)++ ranges from ++\(-\sqrt{2mE}\)++ to
++\(+\sqrt{2mE}\)++).
. Calculate ++\(\langle p \rangle\)++,
++\(\langle p^2 \rangle\)++, and ++\(\sigma_{p}\)++.
. What’s the _classical_ uncertainty product,
++\(\sigma_{x}\sigma_{p}\)++, for this system? Notice that this
product can be as small as you like, classically, simply by sending
++\(E \rightarrow 0\)++. But in quantum mechanics, as we shall see
in Chapter 2, the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator cannot be less
than ++\(\hbar \omega /2\)++, where
++\(\omega = \sqrt{k/m}\)++ is the classical frequency. In that
case what can you say abut the product
++\(\sigma_{x}\sigma_{p}\)++?

* *G.1.13*

Check your results in Problem 1.11(b) with the following “numerical experiment.” The position of the oscillator at time ++\(t\)++ is

++\[x(t) = A\cos(\omega t)\]++


You might as well take ++\(\omega=1\)++ (that sets the scale for time) and ++\(A=1\)++ (that sets the scale for length). Make a plot of ++\(x\)++ at 10,000 random times, and compare it with ++\(\rho[x]\)++.
_Hint_: In Mathematica, first define

[source,mathematica]
----
x[t_] := Cos[t]
----

then construct a table of positions:

[source,mathematica]
----
snapshots = Table[x[𝜋 RandomReal[j]], {j, 10000}]
----

and finally, make a histogram of the data:

[source,mathematica]
----
Histogram[snapshots, 100, "PDF", PlotRange -> {0,2}]
----

Meanwhile, make a plot of the density function, ++\(\rho(x)\)++, and, using `Show`, superimpose the two.

Let ++\(P_{ab}(t)\)++ be the probability of finding the
particle in the range ++\((a<x<b)\)++, at time ++\(t\)++.

[{sublist-style}]
. Show that \[\frac{dP_{ab}}{dt} = J(a,t) - J(b,t)\] where
++\[J(x,t) \equiv \frac{i
    \hbar}{2m}\left(\Psi\frac{\partial\Psi^{*}}{\partial x}-\Psi^{*}\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial x}\right)\]++
What are the units of ++\(J(x,t)\)++? _Comment:_ ++\(J\)++
is called the *probability current* because it tells you the rate at
which probability is "`flowing`" past the point ++\(x\)++. If
++\(P_{ab}(t)\)++ is increasing, then more probability is flowing
into the region at one end than flows out the other.
. Find the probability current for the wave function in Problem 1.9.

(This is not a very pithy example, I’m afraid; we’ll encounter more
substantial ones in due course.)

* *G.1.15*
+

Show that

++\[\frac{d}{dt}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Psi_{1}^{*}\Psi_{2}\,dx = 0\]++

for any two (normalizable) solutions to the same {sch} equation (i.e., with
the same ++\(V(x)\)++), ++\(\Psi_{1}\)++ and
++\(\Psi_{2}\)++.
--

* *G.1.16*
+

A particle is represented (at time ++\(t=0\)++) by the wave function

++\[
\Psi(x,0)=\begin{cases}
A(a^2-x^2)&-a\le x\le +a\\
0 &\textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]++
[{sublist-style}]
. Determine the normalization constant ++\(A\)++.
. What is the expectation value of ++\(x\)++?
. What is the expectation value of ++\(p\)++? (Note that you
_cannot_ get it from
++\(\langle p \rangle = m\frac{d\langle x \rangle}{dt}\)++. Why not?)
. Find the expectation value of ++\(x^2\)++.
. Find the expectation value of ++\(p^2\)++.
. Find the uncertainty in ++\(x\)++ (++\(\sigma_{x}\)++).
. Find the uncertainty in ++\(p\)++ (++\(\sigma_{p}\)++).
. Check that your results are consistent with the uncertainty principle.

* *G.1.17*
+

Suppose you wanted to describe an *unstable particle* that spontaneously
disintegrates with a "`lifetime`" ++\(\tau\)++. In that case the
total probability of finding the particle somewhere should _not_ be
constant, but should decrease at (say) an exponential rate:
++\[P(t) \equiv \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\Psi(x,t)|^2dx=e^{-t/\tau}\]++

A crude way of achieving this result is as follows. In Equation 1.24 we
tacitly assumed that V (the potential energy) is _real_. That is
certainly reasonable, but it leads to the "`conservation of
probability`" enshrined in Equation 1.27. What if we assign to
++\(V\)++ an imaginary part:
++\[V=V_{0}-i\Gamma\]++
where ++\(V_{0}\)++ is the true potential energy and
++\(\Gamma\)++ is a positive real constant?
[{sublist-style}]
. Show that (in place of Equation 1.27) we now get
++\[\frac{dP}{dt} = -\frac{2\Gamma}{\hbar}P.\]++

. Solve for ++\(P(t)\)++, and find the lifetime of the particle in
terms of ++\(\Gamma\)++.
--

* *G.1.18*
+
--
Very roughly speaking, quantum mechanics is relevant when the de Broglie
wavelength of the particle in question (++\(h/p\)++) is greater
than the characteristic size of the system (++\(d\)++). In thermal
equilibrium at (Kelvin) temperature ++\(T\)++, the average kinetic
energy of a particle is

++\[\frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{3}{2}k_BT\]++

(where ++\(k_B\)++ is Boltzmann’s constant), so the typical de
Broglie wavelength is

++\[\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3mk_BT}}\]++

The purpose of this problem is to determine which systems will have to
be treated quantum mechanically and which can safely be described
classically.
[{sublist-style}]
. *Solids.* The lattice spacing in a typical solid is around
++\(d=0.3\,\textrm{mm}\)++. Find the temperature below which the unbound _electrons_ in a solid are quantum mechanical. Below what temperature are the _nuclei_ in a solid quantum mechanical? (Use silicon as an example.)
+
_Moral_: The free electrons in a solid are _always_ quantum mechanical; the nuclei are generally _not_ quantum mechanical. The same goes for liquids (in which the interatomic spacing is roughly the same), with the exception of helium below ++\(4\,\textrm{K}\)++.

. *Gases.* For what temperatures are the atoms in an ideal gas at pressure ++\(P\)++ quantum mechanical? Hint: Use the ideal gas law (++\(PV=Nk_BT\)++) to deduce the interatomic spacing.
_Answer_: ++\(T<(1/k_B)(h^2/3m)^{3/5}P^{2/5}\)++.
Obviously (for the gas to show quantum behavior) we want ++\(m\)++ to be as small as possible, and ++\(P\)++ as large as possible.
Put in the numbers for helium at atmospheric pressure.
Is hydrogen in outer space (where the interatomic spacing is about ++\(1\,\textrm{cm}\)++ and the temperature is ++\(3\,\textrm{K}\)++) quantum mechanical?
(Assume it's monatomic hydrogen, not ++\(\ce{H2}\)++.)

=== The Finite Square Well

* *G.2.29* Analyze the odd bound state wave functions for the finite square well.
Derive the transcendental equation for the allowed energies, and solve it graphically.
Examine the two limiting cases.
Is there always an odd bound state?

* *G.2.30* For a fixed integer ++\(l\)++, normalize the following expression for the even solutions of the finite square well potential by finding ++\(F\)++ and ++\(D\)++:

\psi=\begin{cases}
Fe^{-\kappa x}& x > a\\
D\cos(l x) & 0<x<a\\
\psi(-x)&x<0
\end{cases}\]++

* *G.2.31* Problem 2.31 The Dirac delta function can be thought of as the limiting case of a rectangle of area 1, as the height goes to infinity and the width goes to zero.
Show that the delta-function well, ++\(V(x)=-\alpha \delta(x)\)++, where
++\[
\begin{align*}
\delta(x):=
\begin{dcases}
0&x\ne0\\
\infty&x=0
\end{dcases}, \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x)\,dx=1
\end{align*}
\]++
is a “weak” potential (even though it is infinitely deep), in the sense that ++\(z_0:=\frac{a}{\hbar}\sqrt{2mV_0}\rightarrow0\)++.
Determine the bound state energy for the delta-function potential, by treating it as the limit of a finite square well.
Check that your answer is consistent with the following:
++\[
\begin{align*}
\psi(x)&=\frac{\sqrt{m\alpha}}{\hbar}e^{-m\alpha|x|/\hbar^2}\\
E&=-\frac{m\alpha^2}{2\hbar^2}.
\end{align*}\]++
<This problem has a lot more math with huge ugly equations. I feel like that just grinding out computations isn't really helpful here so I've omitted them.>
