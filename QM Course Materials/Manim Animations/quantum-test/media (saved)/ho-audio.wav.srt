1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
 Okay, let's now take up the famous example of the harmonic oscillator, which you will

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:23,400
 recall even from your studies of elementary classical mechanics, is a situation in which

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,000
 we have a force that's a restoring force, that's why we have the minus sign and the

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,760
 strength of the force is proportional to the displacement x. So the example that you can

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,440
 have in mind for this can be, for instance, a spring with a mass on it that is oscillating,

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:54,840
 vibrating back and forth. Now, bearing in mind that the force F is related to a potential

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:07,920
 in the usual way of minus dv/dx, we see therefore that our potential v(x) is equal to 1/2 kx^2.

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,280
 Now bear in mind as well that because F=ma, we have our classical equations of motion

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:30,440
 being md2x/dt^2 is equal to -kx, and that gives rise to classical solutions that we

10
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:44,360
 can immediately write down in the form x(t)=a*sin(omega t)+b*cos(omega t), where a and b are coefficients

11
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,800
 that are determined by the initial conditions, by the boundary conditions, and as expression

12
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:57,980
 omega is defined to be the square root of the spring constant k over the mass m. Now

13
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:06,240
 this example of the harmonic oscillator equation is incredibly important, and you might say

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,640
 why, why does it crop up so much in physics? And if you haven't seen that yet, you will

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,460
 see it, just about every problem you ever solve analytically in physics in some sense is related

16
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,160
 to the harmonic oscillator. The reason is simply this, if you take any potential at all in

17
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:31,040
 the world, and you expand it in the vicinity of its minimum, then if you call x0 that min,

18
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,720
 then we have v(x0), because x0 is assumed to be a minimum, then next term, which is

19
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,900
 proportional to the derivative of v with respect to x at x0, gives you 0, and therefore the

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:52,440
 first non-trivial term is the quadratic term, 1/2k(x-x0)^2, where k in this expression just

21
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,920
 comes from the second derivative of v with respect to x^2 evaluated at x0. So you see

22
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,960
 right away that any potential in the world, if you are looking sufficiently near a stable

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,280
 minimum, will have deviations of the potential from the value of the potential at the minimum

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:24,400
 given by 1/2k(x^2) or 1/2kÎ”(x^2), which of course is exactly the potential that we have

25
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,980
 associated with the harmonic oscillator. And that's why this example comes up all the time.

26
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,480
 Any potential near its minimum gives rise to fluctuations that look like a harmonic

27
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:47,080
 oscillator. Now of course this is the classical description. If we go on to the quantum description,

28
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:54,920
 well now we know how to do that in terms of Schrodinger's equation, which gives us there

29
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:04,340
 for the equation, whoops, let me go back to where I was here, gives us our equation minus

30
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:16,840
 h-bar squared over 2m d2 psi dx^2 plus v(x), which we'll write as 1/2m omega squared x^2

31
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:27,240
 psi equals e psi. So there we have the quantum mechanical version of the harmonic oscillator

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,760
 seeking the energy eigenstates. Now here is the thing, there are two, well there are many

33
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,360
 ways, but let me just broadly speak, and there are two ways that you can go about solving

34
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,800
 this Schrodinger equation for the harmonic oscillator. The first is, well look, you can

35
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:55,620
 just do brute force solution of a differential equation, right? It's not that hard. However,

36
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:04,080
 you can also take a far more clever approach, which is an algebraic approach, and that more

37
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,920
 clever approach is the one that I'd like to spend a little bit of time now on developing.

38
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:20,280
 And this clever approach comes initially, I believe historically this is accurate, from

39
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:33,160
 Paul Dirac, one of the great pioneers of quantum mechanics, and here's how it goes. So remembering

40
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:43,000
 that the momentum can be written as minus ih-bar d by dx, then the Schrodinger equation

41
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,200
 that we wrote down can simply now be written as 1/2m. p^2 will give us that first equation,

42
00:05:50,200 --> 00:06:00,080
 first term of the equation, and then the potential term we'll write as m omega x^2 times psi,

43
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,920
 and we want all of this to be equal to e*psi. That's the equation that we want to solve.

44
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,880
 Now our inspiration for solving this, or perhaps Dirac's inspiration for solving this, will

45
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,080
 be to note the very simple fact that we're all familiar with, that for ordinary numbers,

46
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,880
 a^2 + b^2, that can be factored as a + ib times a - ib. Good. So let's try to play the

47
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,640
 same game now, but with x's and p's, these operators in quantum mechanics. In other words,

48
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,840
 we're going to try to factor the Schrodinger differential equation. So to that end, let's

49
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,840
 consider two new operators whose definition I'll give you, and the motivation will become

50
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:58,600
 clear in just a moment. Let's call them a+ or - that are defined to be 1/sqrt(2h-bar

51
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:10,960
 m omega - + (that will be corresponding to the plus and minus on the a) ip + m omega

52
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:21,080
 x. Okay, so this is our definition of a+ and a-, and now I want you to note the following.

53
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:31,360
 Let's consider a- times a+. What does that equal? Well, that is 1/2h-bar m omega from

54
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:41,440
 the coefficient out front. The a- term will give us minus, or the a- term gives us a plus,

55
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:51,720
 sorry about that, ip + m omega x. And then the a+ gives us the -ip + m omega x. Good.

56
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,840
 Okay, now let's just expand this out a little bit. So that's 1/2h-bar m omega times, well,

57
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,400
 the ip with the -ip gives us our p squared. The m omega x times itself will give us our

58
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,240
 m omega x squared. And then the remaining part is minus i m omega, after we do a little

59
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:26,480
 bit of cancellation of the h-bar that comes into this, the i omega times xp minus px.

60
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,960
 Let me just make sure I haven't left out any terms. H-bar m omega, yeah, no cancellation,

61
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:39,400
 perfect. Alright, excellent. Okay, given that now, let me just note that if a+ and a- were

62
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:48,440
 ordinary numbers, right, so for classical numbers, of course, xp minus px would simply

63
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,560
 be equal to zero, and that's how, of course, you get to the usual identity that for numbers

64
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,980
 I've written over here. But for operators, for quantum operators, things are a little

65
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:12,720
 bit different because xp is not equal to px, so their difference, xp minus px, which we

66
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,720
 can write as bracket x, p, this generally will not equal to zero. And let me show you

67
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,140
 that explicitly right now. And the way to do this, the way you should always do this

68
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:30,080
 when it comes to operator ordering, is to act on a function, a test function, to see

69
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,840
 how the bracket operates. So let me show you that. So let's take our bracket xp, let's

70
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:44,540
 act on psi of x, and we'll just spell this out. So that's x times minus i h-bar d by

71
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,960
 dx, there's the p, times psi. And now it's the same thing but in reverse order, minus

72
00:09:50,960 --> 00:10:00,960
 i h-bar d by dx, x, psi. Alright, this now we can easily expand out as x times minus

73
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:09,720
 i h-bar d psi dx. And notice that we have another term, the first one, when the dx acts

74
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:19,360
 on the x itself, that will give us a term that looks just like this. Well, I actually

75
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,440
 said that a little bit backwards, let me take that back a little bit. So let me operate

76
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:32,720
 first with the dx on the psi, and pull the x out so I can get my initial cancellation

77
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:43,640
 over here, x i h-bar times d psi dx. But there's a second term from the product rule of course,

78
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:53,400
 where the dx now acts just on the x part over here, and that will give us a plus i h-bar

79
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,840
 times psi of x. So we get this nice little cancellation over here between this term and

80
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,340
 this term, but unlike with ordinary numbers with quantum operators, we have something

81
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:16,280
 left over. x p operating on psi of x is equal to i h-bar psi of x. And since psi of x is

82
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,760
 a completely general function, just a test function, maybe I should have given it a different

83
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:27,180
 name, call it f or t for test function, it doesn't matter, we come to the general recognition

84
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:38,560
 that x, p as an operator is equal to i h-bar. Good. Okay, so given that, let me make that

85
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:49,880
 box a little bit nicer, excellent. Okay. Alright, so given that now, we can write our expression

86
00:11:49,880 --> 00:12:02,360
 for the product of a minus times a plus, that's equal to 1 over 2 h-bar m omega times p squared

87
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,160
 plus m omega x squared, and now that commutator, the bracket of x and p gives us minus i m

88
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,080
 omega, and the bracket part itself is i h-bar. Okay, so if we now look at this, it's kind

89
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:24,920
 of beautiful. We have 1 over h-bar omega times something which you'll note is nothing but

90
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,200
 our Hamiltonian h because we have our nice 1 over 2 m p squared plus our potential term

91
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,720
 x squared, and we have an additional term left over at the end here, which is a factor

92
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,440
 of one half coming from the bracket term on the far right-hand side. From that now, we

93
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:55,160
 can solve for the Hamiltonian h is equal to h-bar omega times a minus a plus minus one

94
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:03,240
 half. Beautiful, simple little formula where we have now successfully factored the quantum

95
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,360
 mechanical Hamiltonian into the product of a minus and a plus with a little correction

96
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:17,360
 term, this little correction piece which is vital, this term of minus one half. Now similarly,

97
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,160
 I'm not going to go through the calculation because it's effectively identical. You could

98
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,520
 also have done the same calculation multiplying not a minus times a plus but a plus times

99
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,960
 a minus, and if you do that, it's a good exercise just to get practice. You will find h equals

100
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:44,120
 h-bar omega a plus times a minus plus one half. That's the only difference when you change

101
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:51,880
 the order of a plus and a minus, and from this you can immediately see, or in fact you

102
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:59,100
 can just calculate it directly from the definition of a plus and a minus. You see that we have

103
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:08,760
 the commutator, the bracket of a minus with a plus is equal to one. You can see that immediately

104
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:16,440
 from the expressions above just by subtracting them, or you could have done that directly.

105
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:25,000
 Good. All right. We're almost at the finish line here because here is the key observation

106
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,440
 once we've done this factoring. Key observation. In fact, there are two key observations. This

107
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,080
 is really the first of them. Imagine that we have some eigenfunction psi of energy E

108
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:48,800
 of this quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. The claim is that if you act with a plus or

109
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:58,440
 a minus on this given eigenfunction and then operate with the Hamiltonian h, you will still

110
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,800
 have an eigenfunction, but the eigenvalue will be different. It will be E either increased

111
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,720
 or decreased by an amount h-bar omega. In fact, let me move this all over so I can fit

112
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:21,800
 this nicely on the screen here. That would be E plus or minus h-bar omega times a plus

113
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:32,080
 minus acting on psi. You see the beauty here is given one eigenfunction of a given eigenvalue,

114
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,840
 these operators that are called raising and lowering operators for reasons now become

115
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:44,840
 clear because a plus raises the energy by an amount h-bar omega and it is an eigenfunction

116
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:52,920
 because this is proportional to a plus acting on psi and a minus lowers the energy by an

117
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:00,120
 amount h-bar omega and indeed, I don't know if you can see that minus, a minus is itself

118
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:08,480
 an eigenfunction as well. That's the key observation and let me just show you how to prove that.

119
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:17,680
 It's quite simple. You just do this one by following your nose. Let's do h on a plus

120
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:26,640
 psi. This is equal to h-bar omega. Now let me substitute in for the Hamiltonian a plus,

121
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,880
 a minus plus one half acting on a plus psi. Now notice what we can do here. We can pull

122
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:45,320
 out an a plus from here and an a plus from this term as well. Let me just do that in

123
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,840
 one step if you don't mind. a plus h-bar omega. When you pull out this first a plus,

124
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:59,320
 what will be left is a minus times a plus and by pulling out the a plus in this term,

125
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:08,280
 all that will be left is one half on psi. Now that's quite nice because you will recognize

126
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:18,860
 this term over here from our calculation above. This looks just like the Hamiltonian except

127
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:27,120
 it's actually the Hamiltonian augmented by h-bar omega. If we go back to our expression

128
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:34,640
 for h, when it's a minus a plus, it needs to be a minus sign but we have over here a

129
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,600
 minus a plus and a plus sign and the difference between them is just a factor of one which

130
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,920
 when multiplied by the h-bar omega out front gives us an h-bar omega inside. Of course

131
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:57,680
 this is all acting on psi and that's nice because h acting on psi just gives us a factor

132
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,920
 of e. After all psi was defined to be an eigenfunction of h with eigenvalue e. The a plus now can

133
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,200
 pull right through those numbers. Let me just bring in the h-bar omega here as well and

134
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:19,720
 so this is all multiplied by the function a plus acting on psi and now this is beautiful

135
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 because this is h acting on a plus psi is equal to a number, the eigenvalue, e plus

136
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,600
 h-bar omega acting on the very same function. Therefore it is an eigenfunction. We have

137
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,720
 successfully raised the energy by an amount h-bar omega. Similarly I'm not going to go

138
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:50,120
 through it, same calculation, if you act with a minus on psi you will get e minus h-bar

139
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,880
 omega, it is still an eigenfunction but now the eigenvalue has gone down by an amount

140
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:05,340
 h-bar omega. And the beauty of this is given this one eigenfunction psi of eigenvalue e,

141
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:13,680
 we now can from it generate a whole tower of eigenfunctions. We can act with a minus

142
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:22,160
 a whole bunch of times, so let me just a minus squared on psi, a minus on psi, psi itself

143
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:30,720
 or we can act with a plus on psi or a plus squared on psi and so on. So given one eigenfunction

144
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,560
 we get a whole series or a whole tower of eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues start with

145
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,720
 an eigenvalue e, in fact let me use a different color to make this a little bit more clear,

146
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:52,720
 I'll use red. So this guy has eigenvalue energy e, this one has eigenvalue e plus h-bar, this

147
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:02,080
 has e plus 2 h-bar, this has e minus h-bar omega, this has e minus 2 h-bar omega and

148
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,840
 on it goes. So that's beautiful, we have an algorithm for generating new eigenfunctions

149
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,000
 from old ones. Now finally I mentioned there's two key observations, let me go to the second

150
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,760
 key observation with simply that because the energy e needs to be greater than the minimum

151
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:32,080
 of the potential energy, we can't continue this series downwards indefinitely, right?

152
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:40,680
 Because at some point this energy e minus n h-bar omega is going to be less than v-min

153
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:48,800
 and that's not okay. So what that means is there has to be some number n such that when

154
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:56,760
 we act with this lowering operator n times on our original eigenfunction it must vanish,

155
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,480
 it cannot be non-zero otherwise we would have generated an eigenfunction whose energy

156
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,920
 was less than the minimum of the potential energy which cannot happen. So let's write

157
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:17,920
 this as a minus acting on a minus to the n minus 1 psi equals zero and let's just call

158
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:25,040
 this guy psi zero, the last eigenfunction that can be achieved by using the lowering

159
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:32,720
 operator because if you use the lowering operator one more time you get zero. That's a beautiful

160
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,960
 equation too because now let's use our definition for a minus so it's 1 over square root of

161
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:51,000
 2 h-bar m omega i p plus m omega x psi not equal zero or as a differential equation let's

162
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:02,920
 spell it out 1 over 2 h-bar m omega times h-bar d by d x plus m omega x psi not equal

163
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:11,160
 zero and that is a differential equation that we can solve very easily, just a nice Gaussian

164
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:23,920
 e to the minus m omega over 2 h-bar x squared and so we have gotten our lowest energy eigenfunction

165
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:32,280
 whose energy eigenvalue e not is such that you can't go any lower than that and from

166
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,520
 psi not now since we're now sort of at the bottom of the series, the bottom of the tower,

167
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:50,640
 psi not with energy eigenvalue e not goes to a plus on psi not which is e not plus h-bar

168
00:22:50,640 --> 00:23:02,880
 omega a plus acting twice takes us to e not plus 2 h-bar omega and on and on it goes to

169
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,080
 generate the rest of the eigenfunctions, the rest of the eigenvalues.

170
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:18,080
