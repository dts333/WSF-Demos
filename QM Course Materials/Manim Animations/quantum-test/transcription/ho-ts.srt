00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
 Okay,

3
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,640
 let's

4
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:01,990
 now

5
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,580
 take

6
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:02,840
 up

7
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,270
 the

11
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,220
 the

14
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,960
 which

15
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,090
 you

16
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,320
 will

17
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,040
 recall

18
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,520
 even

19
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,000

22
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,560
 of

23
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,770
 elementary

24
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,840
 classical

25
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,240

26
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,360
 is

27
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,420
 a

28
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,960
 situation

29
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,090
 in

30
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,400
 which

31
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:23,560
 we

32
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:23,890
 have

33
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,150
 a

34
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,370
 force

35
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:24,850
 that's

36
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:24,930
 a

38
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,230
 force,

39
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,770
 that's

40
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,010
 why

41
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,120
 we

42
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,490
 have

43
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:27,680
 the

44
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,090

 and

47
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,000
 the

48
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000


49
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,740

50
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:29,930
 of

51
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,210
 the

52
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,670
 force

53
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:30,940
 is

54
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,990
 proportional

55
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,170
 to

56
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,450
 the

57
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,570

59
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,170
 So

60
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,430
 the

61
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,040

62
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,400
 that

63
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,580
 you

64
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:35,760
 can

65
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,220
 have

67
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:36,910

68
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,240

69
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,710
 this

70
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,050
 can

71
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,510
 be,

72
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,850
 for

73
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,030
 instance,

74
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,120
 a

75
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,800

76
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,260

77
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:41,350
 a

79
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,090
 on

80
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,290
 it

81
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,740
 that

82
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:42,980

83
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,440

85
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,060

86
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,430

87
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,440
 forth.

88
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,190
 Now,

 there

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,640

525
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,760

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,620
 you

 right?

579
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,580
 It's

580
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:52,910
 not

583
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,620
 However,

620
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,270
 And

621
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,750
 this

1069
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,970
 course,

1070
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,240
 you

1071
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,480
 get

1072
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,690

1073
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:52,960
 the

1080
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:55,980
 I've

1081

1084
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,210
 But

1085
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,530

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,360
 things

1091
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,540

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,790
 their

1105
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,390

1174
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,290
 So

1175
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,430
 let's

1176
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:34,540

1192
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,530
 So

1193
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,200
 that's

1209
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,690

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,290
 me

2536
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:39,490
 use

2537
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:39,540

2551
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,700
 So

2578
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:58,720
 this

2579
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,110
 has

2589
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,330
 So

2590
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:03,640
 that's

2591
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,420
 beautiful,

2592
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,840
 we

2603
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,180
 Now

2604
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,220
 finally

2605
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,300
 I

2606
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,090

2607
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,870
 there's

 we

 can't

 right?

2646
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,960
 Because
