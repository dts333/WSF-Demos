== Special Relativity

[%step]
* REALITY has unexpected features that become manifest at high speeds.
[%step]
** From the perspective of stationary observer:
[%step]
*** Moving clocks run slow (by factor of ++\(\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\)++)
*** Moving objects appear shortened (by factor of ++\(\gamma\)++)
*** Moving object’s mass grows with speed (by factor ++\(\gamma\)++)

== Twin Paradox

[%step]
* Final thought
* Who is moving

[%step]

The Twin “Paradox”
====

[%step]
* Usual solution: to compare watches, one twin must accelerate
* New twist: Spatial direction is compact, say a circular dimension

== Compact Twin Paradox

* [.hl]#Qualitative Solution#
** There is a [.hl]#preferred# frame of reference
** All other frames of reference are in motion relative to preferred frame

== Special Relativity on a circle: Mathematical Setup

[.column]
* Spacetime diagrams
** Traversing the circle, identify ++\(z\to z+2\pi R\)++
** Yellow dots on same horizontal time slice are identified as the same point (by all observers)
